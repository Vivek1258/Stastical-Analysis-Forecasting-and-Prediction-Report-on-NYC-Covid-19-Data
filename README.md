# Stastical-Analysis-Forecasting-and-Prediction-Report-on-NYC-Covid-19-Data
##### In this project I have created a well documented ipython notebook for the analysis of the NYC covid-19 data 
##### For visualizations I have used matplotlib and seaborn labriry 
##### For forecasting I have used ARIMA model 
##### to compare and understand results and performance between statical models and deep learning approch I have created a simple bidirectional LSTM RNN model. That can be used to generate the prediction
